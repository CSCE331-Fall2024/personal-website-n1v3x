        <h4>Engineering Honors Ambassador</h4>
        <p>I am a member of the <a
                href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/eh/student-ambassador/index.html">Engineering
                Honors Ambassador</a> program at Texas A&M.
            We are a group of Engineering Honors students that represent the
            Honors
            program to prospective Texas A&M students, their parents, and other
            students here at A&M.</p>
        <p>Over this course of this semester, I plan to volunteer by helping
            setup/takedown events like the EH Career Fair, work desk shifts at
            the
            Honors lounge, and talk to prospective students and their parents
            during
            campus visits. Our goal is to spread awareness of the honors program
            and
            help ensure that talented students find their way to us.</p>
        <br />
        <h4>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h4>
        <p>Last semester, I started working under Professor Teresa Leyk as a
            Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures & Algorithms course. This
            was a perfect opportunity for me to contribute back to the Computer
            Science community by sharing the knowledge I learned with students
            who are taking the course.</p>
        <p>Some of my responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenting lecture content to groups of 20 students during lab
                sections</li>
            <li>Helping students with C++ and LaTeX homework during labs and
                office hours</li>
            <li>Grading LaTeX homework and checking for cheating</li>
            <li>Weekly meetings with the other TAs and Professor Leyk to discuss
                potential improvements to the curriculum</li>
            <li>Incorporating TA and student feedback to inform improvements to
                MCQ and FRQ question bank</li>
        </ul>
