        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Kevin, and I'm currently a junior Computer Science student at Texas A&M University. I have a deep interest in Natural Lnaguage Processing (NLP) research. I have previous internship experience as a .NET full-stack developer and a backend developer for a telemetry data analysis tool suite.</p>
        <p>I would describe myself as someone who's very structured and organized. I like planning my entire week out ahead of time so that deadlines don't take me by surprise. Planning my week out also allows me to be methodical about how I spend my time. </p>
        <p>In my free time, you can find me bouldering at Stone Co. or working out at on campus! I'm also not opposed to a good chess match. When I'm by myself, I like to read.</p>
        <p>Please reach out if you believe you have a software development opportunity that fits my profile! I'm always happy to connect and have a conversation.</p>
